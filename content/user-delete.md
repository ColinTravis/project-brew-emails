Subject: ðŸš« Brew Break: Account Deletion Notification

Hey [Name],

It's with a heavy heart (and an empty pint glass) that we inform you your [App Name] account has been deleted. If this is a mistake, hit reply, and we'll sort it out faster than you can say "cold one."

Cheers to the memories we shared. If you're ever ready to rejoin the brew crew, we'll keep a spot at the bar warm for you!

Hoppy trails,
[Your App Name]
